/*
 * Solution for Euler problem 031
 *
 * Coin sums
 *
 * In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:
 * 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).
 * It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
 * 1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
 * How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
